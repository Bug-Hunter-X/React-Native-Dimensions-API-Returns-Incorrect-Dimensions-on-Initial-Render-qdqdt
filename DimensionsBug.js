This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions. The issue is that the `Dimensions` API returns an object with `width` and `height` properties. However, the values of these properties are not immediately available during the initial render. This causes components that rely on these values to render with incorrect dimensions, resulting in layout issues or unexpected behavior.
